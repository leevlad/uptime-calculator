# Uptime Calculator

This is the web-app that will hopefully replace the usage of Google
spreadsheets and docs for uptime management. We want the following basic 
features:

* Be able to create features, services, and incidents.
* Be able to search for features, services and incidents easily.
* Comment threads on each incidents, for discussion purposes (think of it as a mailing list)
* Link an incident with a firefighting task in Asana.

Some nice to have features will be the following:

* Nice UI. Headers, footers, bootstrap, et al.
